["Beyond Checkups: Solving the maternal health crisis by putting smart diagnostics, mental health support, and emergency resources into the palm of every mother's hand."]

### The Solution
[Navajanani is designed as a comprehensive digital companion for maternal and postnatal care. It solves the problem of "information gap" and "care fragmentation" by centralizing medical records, doctor consultations, and health tracking into a single, user-friendly interface.
